# Savant-Analytics

Bringing Neural Networks to Stock Market Analytics 

# Installation

Please download the zip file from github and open using the IntelliJ IDE.
This is necessary since the DeepLearning framework I have utilized is optimized for IntelliJ. The free version can be downloaded on IntelliJ's website.

Once you have opened the project in IntelliJ, please make sure the Java SDK is added.

IntelliJ may prompt you to add the .jar files, that are included in the lib folder. Make sure those are installed before running the program.

# Usage

This is a passive system designed to impart stock market advice (Buying/Selling/Holding) to the discerning investor or interested user.

Savant Analytics uses a layered feed-forward neural network that takes in 15 days of intraday stock market analytics to give an informed decision.
  
It primarily uses the VWAP indicator (Volume Weighted Average Price) to make a projection on the behavior of the stock throughout the course of a day.

Meant primarily for day-trading, this passive system allows a trader to make a real-time and informed decision with respect to the historical performance of the stock.
